# Development

This repository is for the discussion of development ideas for the [LISC](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc) tool for automated collection & analyses of the scientific literature. 

The goal of this repository is to separate out code and maintenance questions for the `LISC` package from discussion of ideas and a place to organize on topics about additions or substantial changes to the module.

As a rule of thumb, if an idea or question is about the code in the project, it's likely a code or maintenance problem, whereas if an idea is about the concepts and approach, it's likely a development idea.

### Code or Maintenance Questions

Anything that relates to a bug report, an implementation question, requesting help for using the module, or a feature request that doesn't required a major update (for example, a new function in an existing module, or an extension of an existing functionality) is considered a code or maintenance issue.

Code or maintenance questions should be directed to [issues page](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc/issues) of the [main repository](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc).

### Development Ideas

By development ideas, we mean ideas for a new tool or conceptual approach to be added or drastically changed in `LISC`. This can also include discussion of best practices and tutorial materials for how we want to recommend usage of the tool. Anything that would require a new major release to the codebase is a development idea. 

For example, the following would all be considered development ideas:
- additions of new databases, algorithms, sub-modules or collection approaches to the package
- significant changes to an underlying design of the module, and how it works

For any ideas that fall into this category, please open an [issue](https://github.com/lisc-tools/development/issues) in this repository. 

Once an issue is opened, this repository can then be used by `LISC` developers to discuss and explore these ideas. If an idea is decided upon, a plan will be made for implementation, which can move to a fork or branch of the core repository, once the idea is translated into code tasks.
